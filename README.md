## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- The map element should be a direct child of the HTML body element.
- Local storage is blocking, so its not advisable to use it to store large data
- JSON.strigify - converts to obj to string
- JSON.parse - converts the string to obj, but I'll loose my prototype chain
- location.reload - reloads a page
